# Gaming
All my Gaming Projects using the technologies like C++ in Unreal Engine 4, C# in Unity, SDL (Standard Direct Library) and code samples of data Structures and Algorithms.

1 First Player Shooter Game: 

Project Description - 
Developed architecture, conception, and implementation of gameplay program for FPS game with gameplay mechanics using Hunger System, Inventory pickups, and player objectives, employing analytics and physics to guide behavior of zombies in Unreal. 

Created military simulation and Designed the environment for game setting using blend trees animation, 3-D math and physics including all gameplay elements (features, animation, sound) using technologies like C++ and object-oriented design.

2 Intrusion Detection prototype based on AI: 

Project Description - 
Designed and developed innovative single Player AI game using behavior Trees in Unreal engine to guide behavior of NPCs that patrol a pre-defined path to guard territory and transition from patrolling to defending the territory by coordinating attacks, including behavior such as shooting, seeking cover, flanking using encounter space and EQS systems demonstrating creativity.

3 Knives: Single player 2D game: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Green.Knives)

Project Description - 
Developed a personal 2D game project in C# (visual studio) using the Unity game engine. 

Designed each level in the game to be dynamic to give players a unique experience and to build gameplay systems and tools that make game worlds spring to life. 

4 Developed a Tower Defense Game in C++

Project description -  Tower Defense is a 2-D game which is based on a pathfinding algorithm A*.

In the game an airplane will find a path to the endpoint while the player tries to block its path by placing obstacles.

5. Multiplayer 3rd person Shooter

Project description-  The objective of the game is to defend the team’s own territory while attacking the other team and to win the other team’s territory.

Developed to implement multiplayer shooting game using photon Unity 3-D Networking framework SDK, the gameplay mechanics including military simulations like aiming and shooting the other player using ray casts are coded in C# programming.

Used 3-D math to develop the game and also used blend trees animations for transitioning from moving, aiming to shooting and back.
